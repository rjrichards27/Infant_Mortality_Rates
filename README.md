# Infant Mortality Rates
This report is my R code for the statistical modeling of infant mortality rates. The model used is a hierarchical linear model that looks at the different fixed effects on infant mortality rates and if they vary by location. The specific question being addressed is whether or not access to prenatal healthcare has an effect on infant mortality rates.
